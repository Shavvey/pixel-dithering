# Pixel Dithering Algorithms

## Description

Dithering is an older technique to provide detail to a image by intentionally applying
some form of "noise." There a many different forms of dithering (and they are not even
exclusive to images as some older lossy formats of audio recordings use them). This simple
python script will provide some simple dithering algorithms, usually applied to monochromatic
images (maybe I will figure out some color pallete techniques later to make the images more
interesting)

## Running the Project

The project contains a `makefile`. To run the project, simply type the command:

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** A didn't come up with a good user interface yet, so you'll just have to read the code
and the call the methods you would like to use.
